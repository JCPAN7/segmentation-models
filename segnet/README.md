# An implementation of SegNet.

For the limitation of computational source, I changed the number of the filters in the network structure.

Maybe for that the filters have been reduced, it does not perform as well as U-Net.

The dataset used here is the same as the one in [U-Net](https://github.com/huijianpzh/segmentation-models/edit/master/segmentation_unet/README.md).
